### Project Objective

This project was about working with Web APIs and asynchronous code, creating a web app that uses OpenWeatherMap API to get weather based on typing zip code, and dynamically update UI.

### Building
To get the project up and running I followed these steps:

1. Setting up project environment, making sure You have Express, cors and body-parser installed, and included in my server.js file.
2. Added POST and GET routes to ensure correct retrieval of data from the server.
3. Acquired API credentials from OpenWeatherMap website.
4. Created async functions to fetch weather data and store it on my local server. 
5. Set up a function that updated UI dynamically.
